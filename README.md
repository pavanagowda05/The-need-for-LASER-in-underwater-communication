## 🔍 Methodology (Simplified)

### ① Transmission Principle

Laser converts digital bits (0s and 1s) into light pulses. These are transmitted in free space.

### ② Reception Principle

Solar panel receives light, converts to voltage, Arduino reads the analog values, processes bits, and displays output.
